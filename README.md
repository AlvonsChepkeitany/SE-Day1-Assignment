ANSWERS.
Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Software Engineering is the discipline of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. It ensures software meets user needs reliably, efficiently, and securely. Its importance lies in delivering high-quality software that is scalable, secure, and performs well in a variety of real-world applications.

Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering:

Mastering Complexity: Managing the increasing complexity of software systems.
Mastering Process: Developing standardized processes for software development.
Mastering Machine: Optimizing interactions between software and hardware.
Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Planning: Define requirements and project scope.
Requirement Analysis: Gather user specifications.
Design: Create software architecture and design.
Coding: Write the software code.
Testing: Test for bugs and verify the functionality.
Waterfall vs Agile Methodologies:

Waterfall: Sequential, rigid, suited for projects with fixed requirements (e.g., construction projects).
Agile: Iterative, flexible, suited for projects with changing requirements (e.g., software development).
Roles and Responsibilities:

Software Developer: Develops and maintains the software code.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures the software meets quality standards by testing.
Project Manager: Manages the project, coordinates teams, and ensures timely delivery.
Importance of IDEs and VCS:

IDEs: Help in writing, testing, and debugging code (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
VCS: Allows tracking of changes, collaboration, and error recovery (e.g., Git).
Challenges and Strategies:

Technological Change: Continuous learning and adaptability.
Time Constraints: Agile methods to break down tasks into manageable sprints.
Security: Implement secure coding practices and use tools to identify vulnerabilities.
Types of Testing:

Unit Testing: Tests individual components.
Integration Testing: Verifies that components work together.
System Testing: Validates the complete system.
Acceptance Testing: Ensures the software meets business requirements.
Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Prompt Engineering is the process of creating effective prompts to guide AI models toward generating the desired output. Itâ€™s essential for improving AI's accuracy, relevancy, and reliability in responding to user inputs.
